      <h1>Do you know what is Philately?</h1>
      <p>Philately is the study and collection of postage stamps, postal history, and related materials. It's a hobby
        that has been gaining popularity for centuries. Collectors, known as philatelists, often study the stamps'
        design, history, value, and rarity.</p>

      <h1>A Story of Stamps: The Indian Philatelic Journey.</h1>
      <span>Once upon a time, in the year 1854, a new era began in India. It wasn't the dawn of a new king or a grand
        revolution, but a much smaller, yet significant event: the introduction of postage stamps.
      </span><br>
      <span>These first stamps, known as the "Bullock Cart" stamps, were simple but groundbreaking. They featured a
        humble bullock cart, a symbol of the rural life that was so essential to India's identity. As time went on,
        these stamps became more than just pieces of paper; they became a visual diary of the nation's history.
      </span><br>
      <span>India's rich tapestry of culture, history, and nature was woven into the stamps. Majestic tigers, gentle
        elephants, and colourful birds found their place on these tiny canvases. Important events like Independence Day
        and Republic Day were commemorated, and the nation's rich cultural heritage, from traditional art to vibrant
        festivals, was celebrated.
      </span><br>
      <span>Each stamp told a story, a tiny piece of India's grand narrative. From the early days of the British Raj to
        the vibrant India of today, these stamps have witnessed it all. They are more than just collectibles; they are
        time capsules, preserving the essence of a nation's journey.</span>
